Project Title
Python To-Do List Application

Overview of the Project
This Python To-Do List Application is a simple, menu-driven command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users manage daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, view the current list of tasks, delete completed or unwanted tasks, and exit the program. The application stores tasks temporarily in memory during runtime and provides clear user prompts and input validation to ensure smooth usage.
This project serves as an ideal beginner exercise for learning basic Python programming concepts such as lists, functions, loops, and input handling. It demonstrates how simple data structures and control flows can be used to build practical utility software.

Features
Add new tasks to the list with user input.
Display all existing tasks with numerical order.
Delete tasks by entering the task number.
Continuous user interaction through a friendly menu.
Input validation for tasks and menu options.
Graceful exit from the program with a goodbye message.

Technologies/Tools Used
Python 3 (no external libraries required)
Standard Python built-in functions: lists, print, input
Command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction

Instructions for Testing
Launch the program.
Select option 1 to view tasks (initially empty).
Use option 2 to add tasks; enter the task description when prompted.
Use option 1 again to verify the task is listed.
Select option 3 to delete a task by entering its number.
Enter invalid inputs such as letters or numbers out of range to test error handling.
Exit the program by selecting option 4.
Testing is manual via menu interaction. Observe confirmation and error messages for expected behavior.
