Problem Statement
In daily life, individuals often struggle to efficiently track and manage their tasks, deadlines, and personal goals due to the absence of simple and accessible task management tools. Complex software solutions may be overwhelming for users seeking straightforward functionality, or may require installation and learning effort. This project addresses the need for a minimalistic, user-friendly to-do list application that enables users to organize tasks via a simple command-line interface without any dependencies or complicated setup.

Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to create a lightweight, console-based to-do list application that supports essential task management operations: adding tasks, viewing the current list of tasks, deleting tasks, and exiting the program. The application focuses on ease of use, immediate feedback, and input validation to ensure a smooth user experience. It operates entirely in memory and does not include persistent storage or advanced features like task prioritization or deadlines, thereby maintaining simplicity and clarity. The scope also includes creating clear documentation and a user guide to facilitate understanding and usage.

Target Users
Programming beginners looking to understand fundamental Python concepts through a real project.
Individuals who prefer lightweight command-line tools for basic task management.
Students and hobbyists needing a simple, no-frills to-do list utility.
Users who want to learn or teach basic software design, input validation, and procedural programming techniques.
Those who may not require or have access to graphical or web-based applications but still want to manage tasks digitally.

High-level Features
Add Task: Users can add new tasks by entering descriptive text.
Show Tasks: The application displays a numbered list of all current tasks.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks by specifying their number in the list.
Menu Interface: An interactive menu guides users through available options.
Input Validation: Ensures that task numbers and menu choices are valid inputs.
Graceful Exit: Users can safely exit the program with an exit message.
